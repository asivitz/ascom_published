<p>Did the ‘lazy’ stretching routine on saturday. I liked it. Easy to do all in my bed. Did the stretching ‘standards’ on sunday. Some of them were pretty tough for me; my hamstrings are probably the least flexible thing I have right now. And then more stretching on monday. Not like this guy invented stretching, but if I keep it up I’m sure that alone would make me feel a lot better.</p>
<p>Did the first knee zero workout today. I made it through 3 steps (out of 10). The warmup is basically walking/running backwards. Wasn’t much of a challenge for me, as I don’t really have much knee pain. Would be fun to add resistance to, but hard b/c of pandemic logistics.</p>
<p>First step reminded me of duck walks, which I’ve used in the past to fix shin splints. This seems like a nicer way to progress it though. (Not that I ever thought it was something I needed to progress.)</p>
<p>Second step is a kind of angled calf raise. I haven’t really done calf raises since high school; they never seemed like a weak muscle for me, and actually too strong relative to others. But I guess a big idea here is ankle flexibility.</p>
<p>For both of those, he was clearly way more advanced than me in his videos. So it gives something to shoot for. The next step was a different kind of calf raise so I decided to stop here for today and avoid annihilating my calves on the first day. But I’ll go further next time. I uploaded my videos and I guess I’ll get feedback before the next workout.</p>
<p>So far- they seem like PT exercises where in the past I’d probably say ‘eh I’m good enough. I go back to lifting real weights and doing sports again’ so the magic here I guess is in taking this stuff to a higher level. Looking forward to the next one.</p>
<h2 id="section-1">2/13/21</h2>
<p>So I bought in today. I thought I would do the workout immediately, but after I signed up they said I would write down some info about myself and a coach would reach out to me within a few hours with the plan they wanted me to do, which was fine. I clicked through the website content. I’m looking forward to the ‘standards’, b/c in the past I’ve struggled with knowing whether I was ‘good enough’ on some exercise, and eventually just got bored. Obviously with loaded big movement exercises you just keep increasing the number, but less obvious how far to go with bodyweight and lighter weight exercises.</p>
<p>Anyway, someone did message me (mostly a stock intro) and loaded up a plan into my app. Predictably it was the Knee Ability ZERO. Looks like they give a set schedule of basically M-W-F, which is fine for me. I wonder how flexible it would be if I needed a different schedule. It’s easy enough to message the trainer at least; maybe they could adjust it if I ever needed. It says today (saturday) is for rest, but optionally there’s a stretching routine and also an upper body routine. Again, I like how the stretching routine has standards, b/c I think I’m too tight in some areas but not really sure how bad I am. I’ll do it tonight before bed. I don’t think I can do all the upper body routine b/c some of the stuff requires equipment; not sure. Nbd though.</p>
<p>Sunday is just a rest day by their schedule, and then I’ll start the real workout on monday.</p>
<p>Looks like the real workout is setup as basically the same plan every day (for 12 weeks), but you might not get through all the steps at first. You stop at any step that where you feel pain, and over time you can do more steps, and I guess work toward the standards?</p>
