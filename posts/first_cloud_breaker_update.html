        <p>p | Cloud Breaker is finally out!</p>
<p>| We had a grand release party, with a high score contest streamed to Twitch, and a delicious cake made by a few friends.</p>

<p>p Some early reviews are out, and the feedback is very interesting and helpful. <a href="http://www.148apps.com/reviews/cloud-breaker-review/">This review</a>, by 148Apps, is somewhat representative I think. I really had no idea people would find the game so difficult.</p>
<p>p I think for some players that is a user interface problem. The timer is a big part of the game– the villain if you will, but it doesn’t demand much attention. For new players, the Time Up screen seems to come out of nowhere. I submitted the first update today in an attempt to solve this problem.</p>
<p>if preview a(href=link) Read More else p The solution was a collection of subtle improvements. ul li The timer will be given more attention in the tutorial. li The time blocks are very slightly larger (about 1 pixel). li When running out of time, the expiring time blocks will gently glide into your view, serving as a gentle reminder of your impending doom.</p>
<p>p I cut a short gameplay video showing the changes. (You can also see some beautiful new sky colors. Yum!)</p>

</ol>
<p>p Aside from that, I do think it can be a difficult game, but personally I think that’s a good thing. There’s a pretty long and gradual learning curve. The initial hump can be tricky, but if I can help players get over it, they’ll find a very satisfying progression.</p>
<p>p The 1.0.1 update should be out within a week, depending on the speed of Apple’s review queue.</p>
