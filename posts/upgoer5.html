<li><p>A friend proposed the following challenge: describe your work using only the 1000 most common words in the English language. It’s called the Up Goer Five challenge, because the original idea comes from <a href="http://xkcd.com/1133/">this XKCD comic</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of our friends described their quantum physics research or their social work. I had to describe my approach to making games.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>if preview a(href=link) Read More else p. I actually found it very difficult– not only having to avoid certain words, but also putting my work in such stark terms. It’s interesting though, and I definitely recommend giving it a try, no matter what you do. Here’s an editor: <a href="http://splasho.com/upgoer5/">The Up-Goer Five Text Editor</a></p>
<p>h1 My Entry hr p. I do two different things: I make games and then try to turn them into money. I call my games art though because I build the picture that’s in my head, not the one that would make the most money or even the one that would be the most fun. Part two is hard because it is getting people to buy a game that isn’t built to be bought.</p>
<ol start="16" type="a">
<li><p>Most people these days (but not all) make games by doing both parts at once. To me, this isn’t really art. The money makes the game worse. So, what I’m working on is trying to get parts 1 and 2 to get along, so that I make money, without putting them together, which would make it not art.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s the same thing with popular music and art music, except most people aren’t used to thinking of games as art, so that makes it a little harder. hr</p></li>
