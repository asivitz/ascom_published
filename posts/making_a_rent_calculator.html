        <p>p After the New York Times published a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/science/rent-division-calculator.html?_r=0">fair rent calculator</a> recently, I decided to make my own, based on a method I’ve been kicking around for a while now. I’m not sure how mathematically different it is from the NYT’s, but it’s definitely easier to understand. p <a href="../rent_calculator">Try it out.</a> p A friend pointed out that it can probably be gamed. If I knew someone wanted a particular room, could I keep choosing it to bump up the price? Does the NYT calculator not suffer from this? p Neither of them can handle a couple sharing a room. They should pay more than a single person would for the same room, because they’re also using common space. Perhaps some percentage of the rent could be considered ‘common’ (like 30%), and then the rooms could be priced afterwards to cover the difference. h2 Comments! p As an aside, I added comments to my blog posts using the <a href="http://muut.com">Muut</a> comment system. It looks like neat software and I’m looking forward to seeing it in action. So comment away!</p>
